// create a master list of CSS classes and IDs for all elements

div class = "seats"

    id = "seat1"
    id = "seat2"
    ...
    id = "seat24"

seat class = "taken"
     class = "available"
     class = "selected"

form id = "form"

input id = "name"
      id = "creditCard"
      id = "submit"

p/div id = "confirmation"
  div id = "key"

h1 id = "title"

img id = "image"
    id = "stage"





// Link in Bootstrap to HTML, which includes jQuery

// Create 24 boxes in HTML

// Style 24 boxes in CSS

+ red class to designate taken
+ blue class to designate available
+ yellow to designate current selection


// Use jQuery hover state
+ when hovering over a red seat, display a message saying the seat is taken
+ when hovering over a blue seat, turn the seat yellow (toggle?)
+ when clicking the yellow seat to select, make the form appear

// build the user input form in HTML
+ name input field
+ credit card input field
+ prepopulate the seat assignment in the form
+ submit button that triggers a function -- this function will create an object that represents the user


// in jQuery, write a function to create a user object from the form input

// in jQuery, write a function to update the seat assignment class when a seat is reserved

// in jQuery, write a function to show the form when an available seat is selected

// in jQuery, write a confirmation message that replaces the form

// style the user input form in CSS

// in HTML, write instructions
+ don't forget to design the key
+ paragraph to explain how to use the form/site/whatever

// in HTML, get appropriate image for page
